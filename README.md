## Project Proposal
* We will use heart attack risk factor data
* We will create a machine learning model that can predict (to some extent) heart attack risk based on risk factors. We will use several different machine learning techniques and pick the most accurate technique to use for our model.
* In this process, we will also attempt to determine the most significant risk factors - does cholesterol level matter more than age, for example.
* Finally, we will create a web-based tool based on our model.
